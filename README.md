# Detection-of-Fake-News-using-Machine-Learning-Classification-Algorithms

Developing a machine learning program to identify which news sources might be producing fake news or whether the source is authentic or not. 
The main aim of the model is to focus in identifying fake news sources, based on multiple articles generating from a source. 
Based on the program if the news source is labelled as a fake source, the prediction can be done with high confidence that any further news articles from that source will possibly be fake.Â 
The performance using various classification algorithms will be calculated and evaluated along with the authenticity detection.
